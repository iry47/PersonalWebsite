            Hostels are the home-bases of backpackers: a place to seek shelter, information and friends when arriving in a place where you know nothing and no-one. While it’s rare to find hostels that offer everything you want and just how you like it, I very rarely leave a hostel dissatisfied with its service as a whole. When embarking on your first trip, hostels can seem intimidating and uncomfortable. I’ve met many people who actively try to avoid them. I believe that everyone can benefit from staying in a hostel, and the only thing standing in your way is knowing where to look, what to look for and how to prepare for your stay. I’m not only going to look at hostels from the point of view of a guest, but also for people looking for volunteering opportunities. Over the years I’ve accumulated a lot of experience on both sides of the hostel world, and I hope sharing my experience can make your life easier and maybe even persuade you to try it out!

        <h3>Where to find a Hostel</h3>

            <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com"><img class="photo" alt="HostelWorld" src="<?= base_url("assets/images/hostelworld.jpg")?>"></a>

        </div>
        <div class="points">
        <ul>
            <li>If it is possible and makes sense, it’s always ideal to visit the hostel in person to feel out the environment and negotiate a price.</li>
            <li>Hostelworld and Booking.com are the sites I use and I believe are the most popular, but maybe you’ll find one you prefer.</li>
            <li>HostelWorld is my favourite for User Interface and tends to have a lot of reviews for each hostel. Each reservation has a booking fee which means credit cards are always required.</li>
            <li>Booking.com provides non-hostel options, more customisability to your search and depending on where you are in the world it can show more hostels than HW (often true in South America). Most reservations don’t require a booking fee and often you can book without even using a credit card.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="expandable">

        <div class="section-expand">
            <div class="expandable-text"><p>While in Europe I exclusively used HostelWorld. It was what I was initially recommended and pretty much the only site I ever heard anyone using. The UI is great and since everyone was using it, it was filled with options and reviews. When I got to South America I had to start using Booking.com after I noticed that HW was often lacking in options and sometimes didn’t have a single one, where Booking.com always came through. I also learned later on that I could book through Booking.com without paying for the reservation and the prices were sometimes cheaper than what I saw on HW. Whichever one you end up using, it may be nice to quickly check the other one before making a reservation just in case the price is different.</p><p>When travelling during high season (it varies depending on location but school vacations are usually a good rule of thumb) it is best to reserve a couple days before because hostels tend to fill up, especially if you’re going to a party place for the weekend. Travelling during low season is the opposite and I almost never make reservations — not saying there’s no risk of hostels filling up, you should do what you believe is best. You can call the hostel a few days before your planned arrival to ask how many beds are available the night you’re looking to book. I find that hostels often don’t list all the beds on these sites all at once. If I’m arriving early enough in the day, I prefer to choose an area that has a few options and go to visit each of them to pick out my favourite and negotiate prices. If I don’t feel like walking around (which happens after long days of travel) then I still wouldn’t reserve and keep the option of abandoning my first choice if it is really bad. After some trial an error you’ll design your own system and in no time you’ll be consistently pleased with hostels since you’ve already set yourself up to arrive in a place that meet your basic requirements. Now what are some basic requirements?</p></div>

            <p>When looking for volunteering opportunities in hostels, the websites are completely different and often require a paid subscription. Even if you’re travelling only for several weeks, if you have the time to stay a week volunteering then I believe you can quickly pay off the subscription through the money saved on accommodation and food. I bought a subscription to Workaway (US$35): the first site that I was introduced to that has a list of volunteering opportunities categorised first by area and later by much more. This site as a policy of a recommended 25h of volunteering per week for free accommodation and at least some food, however I rarely chose a place that didn’t have all food included as well. Outside of Workaway I’ve heard of WorldBackpackers, which I believe offers almost the same service for a similar price, but I’m sure there’s more out there so don’t be afraid to do your own research!</p>

            <li><b>Read reviews</b>, being the truest way to learn about the vibe and quality of everything they offer.</li>
            <li>Look at the map, because not everyone wants to be an hour from the centre and vice-versa.</li>
            <li>Make a list of requirements that you’d like the hostel to have. Look at the filters available on the sites for ideas.</li>
            <li>Photos are always nice to look at but aren’t guaranteed to be true.</li>

            <p>Before searching for a hostel, it’s important to know what sort of environment you’re looking for. Great hostels have spaces for everyone, but often hostels can be classified as calm or party, great facilities (bed, bathrooms, common areas) or okay facilities, etc. Most of the complaints I hear about hostels are when someone ends up in a hostel providing an incompatible environment for said traveler. This doesn’t mean all hostels are bad, this just means you could have chosen better. I personally change the type of hostel I stay in depending on my mood of the day, whether I’m looking to work in a comfy common room, be really social and party or maybe I’m just looking find  the cheapest single room. </p>
                <p>When scrolling through a list of hostels, I like to have a couple basic filters to reduce the list. I personally always order by price, and then usually only look at hostels with breakfast included since I enjoy waking up with the first step of the day taken care of for me so I can focus on organising the day ahead. I also often have an idea of where I’d like the hostel to be located, and even if I don’t I still look at the map and judge its location based on points of interest like city centre, water, transportation, etc. Once you have your list of initial requirements set then you can take a quick look at the picture, rating and number of reviews before diving into the hostel’s page. There I usually glance at the description, but if in a rush the only important thing in my mind is reading the reviews. This is where you’ll find out if what you’re seeing about the hostel is true, and what quality they offer. I’m usually looking for comments about the quality of the breakfast, wifi and environment, whether they have security lockers and everything else that catches my eye. If there is only one thing you want to do when looking for hostels then reading reviews is it.</p>

                <p>Before I get into it, I want to refer you to the first paragraph of the hostel section above because that is equally true for volunteering: it’s all about the environment you’re looking to be in. </p>
                <p>When looking for any volunteering opportunity, it’s important to clearly communicate with your host about what you are looking for and what they are looking for. The key to being in a happy environment is avoiding negative surprises. Be sure you’re happy doing the volunteering work, and always confirm exactly what they want you to do because it can differ from what is written on their profile. When working in hostels I, after doing a lot of it, avoiding going to places that had me cleaning bathrooms. I looked exclusively for reception work, leading activities or working at the bar. I also looked specifically for places that offer at least 1 meal a day and I often ended up with all 3 meals included, which is the key to saving money. Outside of this, read above at choosing a good hostel since it all applies here as well. </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Tapestry style sheet</b>: one of the essentials in my travel kit, acting as a beach blanket, hostel bed curtain, bus blanket and even a towel when I forget my real one!</li>
            <li><b>Lock</b>: hostels often don’t provide locks for their lockers without renting or selling them, and when there isn’t a locker it’s nice to be able to lock your bag shut.</li>
            <li><b>Universal adapter</b>: an adapter that fits into all plugs, accepts all plugs and also acts as a power bar with two usb ports is something you will use every day of your trip.</li>
            <li><b>Ear plugs / eye cover</b>: I personally tend to always sleep well so I don’t pack these, but won’t deny that having these handy can make your life a lot better. </li>

            <div class="expandable-text"><p>I bought a tapestry (which is what I called a large thin sheet with a cool design) early on in my trip and it rarely leaves my side. It has so many uses in any trip, and having a little bit of privacy in bed is priceless. Works best when you have a bottom bunk in a corner, and when combined with your towel you’ve created a sealed pod (some hostels already offer pods with curtains, and more and more are popping up every day). Often rooms have some sort of locker service, but either way it’s nice have a lock to lock your bag when it’s out of your side behind the curtain. And while the curtain provides a bit of blockage when the light is turned on (depending on the curtain) it may still be nice for you to have an eye-cover and earplugs.</p></div>

                Outside of having the things to make your visit a little more comfortable, the key to enjoying the hostel is to use it for its purpose: to meet fellow travellers! Don’t hesitate to spark up a conversation, and if feeling a little too shy to do so then just wait and smile and I can almost guarantee someone will say something to you. Often people in hostels are travelling alone and feeling just as vulnerable as you. While the rooms may be comfy, try and spend time in the common room and join activities that are either organised by the hostel or maybe just by someone walking out the door. That being said, if you’re already travelling with someone then try and invite along a new person with you. While you may not get along, it’s only a couple hours and it’s nice to change the travel group dynamic, especially if you’ve been travelling together for a long time.</p> 
                <p>Aside from meeting people, hostels are also an awesome place to stop by if you need help: Whether you're only in the place for the day and looking to drop bags off; looking for some general information to get a lay of the land; or maybe you're alone in an airbnb but looking for a fun night out. Most hostels are there to help whether you're a client or not. Below I’ve thrown together a list of things I also love for a hostel to have.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drinkable water</li>
                    <li>Selection of cooking spices</li>
                    <li>Provided towel</li>
                    <li>Coffee and tea available all day</li>
                    <li>Daily activities</li>
                    <li>Dinners (free is preferred but even paid is nice)</li>
                    <li>Pod beds with storage drawers</li>
                    <li>Accessible plugs and personal light</li>
