                <p>I spent 5 months living in a small French town called Champagny en Vanoise, collectively running a chalet complex with 5 other people. Growing up far from the mountains and choosing hockey as my primary winter sport, this was my first opportunity to indulge in snowboarding for a consecutive period of time - I even learned to love skiing as well! For anyone who loves to ski, this is an excellent way to make a bit of money while having an experience of a lifetime. However, organising it all can seem daunting and there’s a lot of hurtles in the way before you arrive: choosing a resort, finding a company/job and dealing with visas can all seem overwhelming, but like everything is just taking one step at a time!</p>
                <p>As much as I wish I could say I’ve been to tons of resorts around the world, my experience is actually quite limited. Because of this I’m going to talk more about the resort I was at and what I learned, and hopefully the knowledge can help you in your quest! </p>

                        <div class="expandable-text"><p>My travels are rarely pre-organised or executed according to plan, and this was no exception. A friend and I realised in Barcelona how much we loved to snowboard and decided to embark on the mission of finding a job for the upcoming season. Having lived in England for half of her life, she was aware that it is very common for English families to pay an English company to organise their ski trip to the alps, including hosting them in an all-inclusive chalet. Therefore it is common for English people to work for English companies in the French alps. Perfect! She’s already English and me being Canadian can get a visa for the UK no problem. France is popular choice and bonus for me because I already speak the language. We began our search on the variety of English websites with job postings for seasons in France and started applying. A couple of the big sites we used and found helpful were : </p>
                            <p>Links</p><p>Many of the companies only accepted employees with EU nationality because, as I learned later on, visas become complicated for non EU citizens, working for a country outside of the Schengen zone but living inside the Schengen zone. In the end, our decision was entirely based on putting all our eggs into the one basket that appeared to have the best chance of working out, and it did !</p>

                        <li>Life is a lot easier if you can choose a location somewhere you’re legally allowed to work.</li>
                        <li>When choosing a country, think about the language</li>
                        <li>If you’re skiing in one place everyday for months, it’s nice if there’s a lot of terrain</li>

                    <div class="expandable-text">Champagny en Vanoise is a small ski resort on the south side of the mountain, with a view across the valley to Les Trois Vallées (super fancy). Luckily, even though Champagny has only two chairlifts and a handful of runs, it connects to La Plagne on the north side of the mountain and Les Arcs across a valley in the north to make the combined terrain of Paradiski. We had access to 141 chairlifts, 967 accomodation options, 475 runs to make up 425km of downhill skiing, 12 ski villages, 5 ski resorts, …I think you get the picture. I really loved the ability to not only explore all the terrain during the day, but also come back to a smaller, authentic French resort that wasn’t filled with vacationers looking to party every single night. Champagny has 1 bar, 1 bar/restaurant, 6 hotels, 1 gondola…the opposite picture. We were easily able  to go out for a quiet beer after a long day of work and ski but also had awesome reggae events to look forward to every couple weeks in Code Bar. We often hear life is about balance and that’s what we found in Champagny, which helps explain why the same people seem to return every year.</div>

                    <div class="expandable-text"><p>I was hired by Barrelli Ski, who operates two large chalets with a capacity of ~15 people each and two smaller apartments with a capacity of ~5. Our team of six was divided in to 2 managers, 2 head chefs and 2 assistants who worked together to provide breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner and cleaning 6 days a week (same meals every week). One of the six days was changeover day, spent almost entirely deep cleaning all the chalets and the seventh day (Wednesday) was completely off. We were able to ski everyday (minus changeover) from about 11-4, which is an average time that was shorter in the beginning of the season and longer after we ironed out the kinks of the job. The accommodation for the staff were private rooms for each couple — the owner realised after several years that couples in the close-knit environment last longer and were generally happier throughout the season. All the staff also received a ski pass for the season, rental equipment, food, and a minimum salary of £400 / month which accumulates slowly but surely when you have no expenses.</p>

                    <div class="expandable-text"><p>Being Canadian, I got the Youth Mobility Visa for the UK which has a duration of 2 years. It costed £100 and took about a month to get, although I went about it in a very round-about way. At the time of realising that the job hunt was serious and we were going to make it happen, I had been working in Barcelona with a Spanish visa and already booked a flight to Poland to begin a tour of eastern europe. So I ended up being a Canadian with a Spanish residency applying for an English visa in Warsaw but getting it sent to Budapest (where I planned to be around the time it would be sent). I still don’t fully understand the whole process, and if my Spanish residency affected my ability to apply for the visa outside of the UK, but point is to avoid finding yourself in a similar situation, and if you find yourself in the exact situation then you can rest assured that it is possible.</p> 
                        <p>Showing my visa to my employer was all I needed to be employed, placed in payroll and have everything set on the english side. Living in France, inside of the Schengen zone without a Schengen visa was a different story. There is another level of documentation that has to be done by you/your employer to post you in France. This is something that is best to talk to your employer about and confirm that everything is done correctly. </p>

            <div class="article-text"><p>While the repetitiveness of the job became tiresome and living in such close proximity to few people for so long also had its complications, this was one of the best jobs I’ve ever had and an experience I will value for the rest of my life. Skiing requires such specific conditions and is hard for the average person to enjoy any day they’d like to, so if you love the sport then this is an easy, affordable way to make it happen. The job comes in so many different flavours, and if you’re interested in the opportunity then there’s definitely a place that meets your specific requirements. Don’t take my experience as a representation of the average, but use it to help direct your compass to your ideal job!</p>
