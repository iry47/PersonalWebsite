            Unsurpringsly and quite frankly, thankfully, the Amazon doesn’t have many roads. While the bigger cities are connected with airports, the rest of the jungle is exclusively boat access. I arrived in Belém, which is located at the foot of the Amazon River entering into the Atlantic ocean. Belém is the last stop along the northern coast of Brazil that is connected by highways. If you’re planning on taking a ferry through the jungle, there’s little information available online and what is available is incomplete if true at all. I’m going to take you through my experience and share the important information needed to buy your ticket, prepare for the boat and enjoy the ride. Each section has key points with an expandable full paragraph just underneath. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ticket Purchase</h3>

        <div class="points">
        <ul>
            <li>Tickets are sold at the Hidroviaria (main port) in your respective location.</li>
            <li>Bigger cities like Belém have vendors in uniform, if not then look for official company stands — and don’t forget to bargain!</li>
            <li>Once your ticket is purchased, the moment your boat arrives you have the right to stay in the boat and save on accommodation.</li>
            <li>R$170 Belém to Manaus for 5 days 6 nights without food included (but available) on Nélio Corrêa</li>
            <li>R$320 Manaus to Tabatinga / Leticia for 6 days 6 nights with food included on Diamante</li>

            <div class="expandable-text">I arrived in Belém with little information about how exactly I was going to embark on my boat adventure. Speaking to my couchsurfing host and other people, they showed me several times, the schedules and prices that were available online. Luckily it had been 5 months that I had been in Brazil and almost a year that I had spent in South America and I knew to take all of this advice with a grain if not an entire rock of salt: in my experience, online resources in 2018 for South American countries and specifically Brazil were rough versions of the reality. Arriving at my first Hidroviaria in Belém, I was hardly surprised to find prices that were half those listed online and almost double the amount of departures times. The uniformed vendors throughout the station were immediately dropping from the listed price of R$340 to R$250 and in the end I paid R$170, which was an extremely low price and I actually received some unhappy reactions from passengers when checking into the boat. I also believe that prices change not only throughout the year and everyday leading up to your departure, but also depending on which hidroviaria you leave from: some locations (equivalently companies) seem more happy to bargain than others.</div>

        <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <div class="photos">
            <img class="photo" alt="hammocks in amazon boat" src="<?= base_url("assets/images/hammocks.jpg")?>">

            <img class="photo" alt="amazon boat meal" src="<?= base_url("assets/images/refeicao.jpg")?>">
        </div>
        <ul class="points">
            <li><b>Hammock:</b> where you’ll be spending the majority of your time so it’s worth it to get a comfortable one, which are always still very affordable.</li> 
            <li>Blanket: lightweight so it's not a pain to carry around before and after, but something is definitely nice for the chilly, breezy nights.</li>
            <li><b>Rope, locks:</b> useful for adjusting your hammock to the perfect length and also for securing your belongings to the pallets or posts to prevent quick robberies.</li>
            <li><b>Food:</b> you’re in Brazil, so don’t expect anything other than rice, beans, spaghetti, meat and the occasional vegetable. Maybe, you’ll be lucky and have a day with fish.</li>
            <li>Tupper: A plastic container is useful if you want to eat outside of the dinning room or if you want to take bigger portions - my boat with food included was buffet-style.</li>
            <li><b>Water:</b> Both trips I bought large bottles (5L) of water. In my mind, if you start to feel sick for whatever reason then having trustworthy water could make all the difference. </li>
            <li><b>Electronics:</b> there are plugs on the boat but not always ideally placed. If you’re pre-downloading entertainment then an extension cord is a good idea.</li>
            <li><b>Mosquitos:</b> even when you’re close to the coast and where the mosquitos are, the wind created from the moving boat is sufficient to eliminate virtually all mosquitos. </li>
        </ul>

        <button class="btn btn-hg btn-primary text-expand">Expand to read more <i style="float:right" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
        <div class="section-expand">
            <div class="expandable-text"><p>The first and most important item in your checklist is a hammock. While private rooms are available for two people at double the price each, the majority of people end up spending over 15h a day in their hammock — a number I just made up, but I didn’t spend an abnormally large amount of time in my hammock and I easily got to 16h/day. I was actually gifted my hammock by a traveller that had just done the trip. The hammock was gifted to him and I gifted it to someone else, so keep your eyes peeled in hostels on your way there!</p>
            <p>Security on the boat is non-existant so it’s best to keep your things in sight or have them covered and tied down when there not. While saying this, my experience on the boat was nothing but positive: the majority of people on the boat are locals visiting family or friends and I often left bags in the company of new friends. The times to be vigilant are when people are entering and leaving the boat, whether that is at the port or when boats are attaching-on mid-river to sell food.</p>
            <p>I never had any trouble with the food on the boat, but some people did. I believe it helped that I had already spent so much time in the country and continent adjusting to the foreign bacteria. Minus the occasional soup or vegetable, the food is exclusively rice, beans, plain spaghetti and meat (usually chicken). I definitely suggest buying fruit and some tasty raw veggies before getting on the boat. I personally always bought water as well. Some boats have their water supplied by smaller boats which fill the tank with a hose: hard to believe is clean. While some boats bring in sealed 10L bottles of water and fill up the tank, there still no guarantee that the tanks are properly cleaned. Maybe I’m paranoid but I just feel more comfortable having trustworthy water while eating low nutritional food in a metal tank filled with hundreds of people cruising through the jungle.</p>
            <p>The boats always have chargers somewhere, and some more readily available than others. If you’re hoping to spend time in your hammock using your tech then I’d suggest getting a cheap extension cable and choosing your hammock location wisely. As a rule of thumb, <b>never leave any device charging unattended</b>. Even in boats with cameras and friendly looking people, it’s just too easy for someone to snatch it and never get caught. </p>

        <h3>Enjoying the Ride</h3>
        <div class="photos">
            <img class="photo" alt="friends on amazon boat" src="<?= base_url("assets/images/boat-crew.jpg")?>">
        </div>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>Choose a good hammock spot away from the bathrooms and closer to the middle (away from high foot traffic areas)</li>
                <li>Chat with the locals and practice your Portuguese </li>
                <li>Be aware of the planned stops and take advantage of the time to explore the town, while being aware that these periods have the highest probability of theft.</li>
                <li><b>Coast watch: you’re on the boat to experience the jungle, don’t forget to look!</b></li>
                </ul>
            <div class="expandable">
        <button class="btn btn-hg btn-primary text-expand">Expand to read more <i style="float:right" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
                <div class="section-expand">
                    <p>It may seem like choosing the perfect hammock spot is an important task, but the majority of the spots are all the same. Depending on the boat, the bathrooms might not even be in the same area as the hammocks, in which case you want to focus on being away from the footpaths and the entering sun from the windows. Don’t be afraid to ask the crew, because they are usually pretty familiar with the trip! I found it really nice to get to know the crew and people on board not only for Portuguese practice, but also to know what is going on: planned stops, duration, when a suspected thief is on board, etc. If you don’t know Portuguese or Spanish (they are so similar that conversations are possible between unilingual speakers) then don’t be afraid to communicate through the international body language — waving your hands and pointing at stuff!</p>
                    <p>The first few days on the boat I was very paranoid about stops, staying in my hammock the entire time and waking up for every stop during the night. While I think this is an excellent way to prevent your things from getting robbed and avoid having a new neighbour above, below or too close to your hammock, it is kind of annoying and I quickly became more relaxed. My updated method was trying to find a neighbour that was staying around our hammocks to keep an eye on my big clothes bag that was tied down to the wooden pallet. With this friendly guard I left the boat with my small bag of important things and used the time to explore the city and usually hunt down some tasty açai. Extremely important to talk to the crew and find out the estimated stop time, because the boat doesn’t wait for late travellers and losing your clothes, hammock and rest of the trip is far from ideal. </p>
                    <p>Something I’ve left for last but in my opinion the most important thing to do on the boat: watch the jungle! While things may look still, the amazon is always bursting with life and after days on the boat you’ll definitely be able to see dolphins, a large variety of birds and if you’re lucky snakes, monkeys, sloths and more! I lucked out but if you can then try and do the trip against the current, or heading west. While this adds a bit more time to the trip, the boat cruises along side the coast where the current is weaker so you spend far more time with great views of the jungle!</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div class="article-text"><p>I found it best to treat the boat ride as a forced vacation where you have few options other than relaxing and getting to know the amazon and its people. Boat rides can also be an awesome time of isolation, if you’re looking to work on a project or maybe get into a new habit like meditation. But whatever way you decide to spend your time, something on everyone’s list should be to take it all in. You’re cruising through the lungs of the planet, a place with one of the highest degrees of diversity in the world of not only animals but us humans as well. You have the ability to interact with communities that have only recently become aware of the rapidly changing modern society that is directly threatening this local diversity of life. One of the most frustrating things to see was the threat from the inside: the amount of people throwing plastics and garbage into the streets, river and jungle! While many of you reading this have been taught how wrong this is, I believe the Brazilian locals are showing a lack education not a lack of respect so be patient and you can try to talk to them peacefully about the damage they’re unknowingly causing.</p>
	       <p>I was really able to learn a lot from the jungle: widen my perspective outside of the western mentality and see that we are far from having all the answers. There is not only one way to live life, and the path to world peace will only be achieved through the knowledge of every community. </p>
